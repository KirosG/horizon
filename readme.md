The Curved Horizon of Literary History
======================================

Research related to evolving book manuscript, *The Curved Horizon of Literary History.*

Please note, "evolving." None of this is ready to review yet.

With a few exceptions to be described below, code, data, results, and viz scripts are saved in the appropriate chapter folder.

**Things to be added before this goes in Zenodo**

1. A version of the overlappingcategories repo, which is invoked in Chapters 2 and 3.

2. For chapter 3, fiction and poetry counts derived from extracted features. (I don't think it's necessary to reproduce the extracted features themselves; those are publicly available.)

chapter1
--------
Do we understand the outlines of literary history?

chapter2
--------
The lifespans of genres.

chapter3
--------
The pace and direction of literary change.

chapter4
--------
The instability of gender.

chapter5
--------
The risks of distant reading. Not included in the repo, because there's no supporting data.

appendixA: Data
----------------
This is more of a descriptive overview of the repo than a separate dataset.

appendixB: Methods
------------------
Includes one illustration.

scan
----
Code and data for characterizing poetic form, especially rhyme and metrical *scan*sion. Probably won't be used in the book itself, since it turned out not to be useful for predicting prestige.

    "This notebook explains how I used the Harvard General Inquirer to *streamline* interpretation of a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm italicizing the word \"streamline\" because I want to emphasize that I place very little weight on the Inquirer: as I say in the text, \"The General Inquirer has no special authority, and I have tried not to make it a load-bearing element of this argument.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "To interpret a model, I actually spend a lot of time looking at lists of features, as well as predictions about individual texts. But to *explain* my interpretation, I need some relatively simple summary. Given real-world limits on time and attention, going on about lists of individual words for five pages is rarely an option. So, although wordlists are crude and arbitrary devices, flattening out polysemy and historical change, I am willing to lean on them rhetorically, where I find that they do in practice echo observations I have made in other ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should also acknowledge that I'm not using the General Inquirer as it was designed to be used. The full version of this tool is not just a set of wordlists, it's a software package that tries to get around polysemy by disambiguating different word senses. I haven't tried to use it in that way: I think it would complicate my explanation, in order to project an impression of accuracy and precision that I don't particularly want to project. Instead, I have stressed that word lists are crude tools, and I'm using them only as crude approximations.\n",

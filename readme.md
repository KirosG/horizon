The Curved Horizon of Literary History
======================================

Research related to book manuscript, *The Curved Horizon of Literary History* (Underwood, 2017).

The manuscript is now under review, and reviewers are also invited to inspect this repository. But note that I'm still working quite actively on the repository, and in particular, still testing that things run when this is cloned on a fresh machine. I would not be at all surprised to hear that there are loose ends here.

The code and data needed to reproduce claims and figures in a given chapter are saved in the chapter folders. I would also

chapter1
--------
Do we understand the outlines of literary history?

chapter2
--------
The lifespans of genres.

chapter3
--------
The pace and direction of literary change.

chapter4
--------
The instability of gender.

chapter5
--------
The risks of distant reading. Not included in the repo, because there's no supporting data.

appendixA: Data and reproducibility
------------------------------------
This may be the place to start if you're thinking about attempting to reproduce a particular result. The folder contains a general "guide to reproducing results," and code I used for word counting, as well as a draft of appendix A itself.

appendixB: Methods
------------------
Includes one illustration.

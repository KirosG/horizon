Chapter 1 lexicons
=================

Just some lists of words used in this chapter.

**MainDictionary.txt** is a large (but not exhaustive0 list of English words, compiled from several sources now lost to me, including Google Books.

**colors.txt** is, as advertised, a list of color words.

**stanford.csv** is a list of "hard seeds" and "abstract values" from [Heuser and Le-Khac, Stanford Lit Lab pamphlet #4.](https://litlab.stanford.edu/LiteraryLabPamphlet4.pdf)

**inquirerbasic.csv** is a list of words associated with categories in [the Harvard General Inquirer.](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/) Note that I am using the Inquirer strictly as a source of wordlists, without the more sophisticated disambiguation rules available in the server version.

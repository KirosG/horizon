visualization scripts
======================

Mostly self-explanatory, but note that the "boxplot" figure no longer actually uses boxplots. (Boxplots are super-informative for an audience that is used to them, but I don't expect the audience for this book to be used to them, so I turned it into a jitterplot.)

These names should align to the names of images in the [**../images**](https://github.com/tedunderwood/horizon/tree/master/chapter1/images) folder.

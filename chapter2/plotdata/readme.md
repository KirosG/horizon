Chapter Two plotdata
====================

**paceofchangeinDetective.tsv** and **paceofchangeinSF.tsv** are produced by code/reproduce.py:

    USAGE: python3 reproduce.py mutualrecognition

They are then used to make figure 2.3.

**sfsurprises.tsv** is data that I used to understand the accelerated pace of change in mid-20c SF; it was produced by code/find_surprises.py
